                                Enrolling myself in this course was one of the best decisions I made in my professional career. I learned a lot from this course and it also helped me land my first job, as the team, The Second Visit, is widely known to be the best in building the clinical excellence of Physio in different parts of the world. Personally, it helped me learn new skills and build my confidence to talk with potential employers and in less than a week after attending the course in Sydney I had a successful interview with my current employer. In two weeks time, I will be having my first day in private practice here in Australia. Can’t speak highly enough of James and The Second Visit team for creating the community!

                                In my master's program, James and his team allowed us to experience working in private practice, which was invaluable to me when I started my own private practice in India. It helped us improve both our technical and soft skills, ensuring success. I am excited to participate in " The Manual to Great Therapy" in the next two weeks along with my team members.
